## Library App

The goal of this project was to practice object oriented programming with C#, using .Net framework, with a stress on MVVM architecture and test driven development, in order to create a library app in which one can search for items (using LINQ for queries) and add items.

Application:
1. Use the general search and find an item by title, price, language or publication year (the categories in common for all item types in the library).
2. Search for a specific item type – book/journal/audiobook. This will open a new window with the specific categories for each type ('narrated by' for audiobook 'edition' for journal etc.).
3. Add an item to the library. This will open a new window with all fields needed.
