Second project – Library

The goal of the project was to practice object oriented programming with C# using the .Net framework, 
with a stress on MVVM architecture and test driven development.  

Application:
1.You can use the general search and find an item by title, price, language or publication year 
  (the categories in common for all item types in the library).
2.You can search the library for specific item type – book/journal/audiobook. 
  This will open a new window with the specific categories for each item ('narrated by' for audiobook 'edition' for journal etc.).
3.You can add an item to the library. This will open a new window with all fields needed.
